### Hi, I'm Alvin Tang ðŸ‘‹

**I am a Full Stack Software Development Engineer at [Varicent](https://www.varicent.com/).**

I strive to create powerful tools that enable flexibility and makes processes more efficient. I graduated from the University of Toronto in 2021 with a Computer Science degree. I've previously interned at OpenText where I worked on the [Developer Experience](https://developer.opentext.com/) platform, and at the Government of Canada as a Web Developer. In addition, I've worked as the tech lead at [Live Competition](https://www.live-competition.org/) where I led a team of student developers that built an all-in-one university business case competition platform.
