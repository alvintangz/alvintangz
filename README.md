### Hi, I'm Alvin Tang 👋

I strive to build user-friendly tools that people genuinely like to use, whether it’s to improve productivity or support better health. I’m a Computer Science graduate from the University of Toronto and currently work at [Varicent](https://www.varicent.com/), where I build internal generative AI tools using cutting-edge tech to support teams like sales, education, and marketing. I own projects end-to-end and enjoy turning ideas into things people actually use.

Previously at [Varicent](https://www.varicent.com/), I worked on Sales Planning, helping take a new product from proof of concept to an enterprise-scale solution while working full-stack on features like data cloning, internationalization, and notifications. On my GitHub, you’ll find personal and university projects, plus open-source work with [Vaccine Hunters Canada](https://vaccinehunters.ca/) that helped 2M+ Canadians find vaccines.
