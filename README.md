### Hi there ðŸ‘‹&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm Alvin Tang

I am a fourth-year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto. I've previously interned at OpenText working on the [Developer Experience](https://developer.opentext.com/) platform, and at the Government of Canada as a Web Developer. In addition, I've worked as the tech lead at [Live Competition](https://www.live-competition.org/) - led a team of developers that built an all-in-one university business case competition platform.

Worked with various languages and frameworks. I primarly use JavaScript and Python the most though.
